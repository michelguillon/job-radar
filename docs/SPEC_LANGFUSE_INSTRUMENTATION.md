# SPEC_LANGFUSE_INSTRUMENTATION.md
## Langfuse Instrumentation — cv-tailor + Job Radar

**Status:** Specced — not yet built
**Prerequisite:** `SPEC_LANGFUSE_DEPLOYMENT.md` complete and healthy ✅
**Build order:** cv-tailor first, Job Radar second
**SDK version:** langfuse v4 (current as of June 2026 — `pip install langfuse` installs 4.7.x)

> **Note:** This spec was originally written against SDK v2. All code blocks
> have been rewritten for SDK v4. The v4 SDK is OTel-based — the API is
> context manager and decorator driven, not object-chaining. The trace
> structure (section 2.2) is unchanged — only the Python code to produce it.

---

## 1. Instrumentation philosophy

**Trace what matters, not everything.**

The goal is evidence for the §7 research questions from the integration
spec — where do Job Radar and cv-tailor scores diverge, and why? That
means tracing at the decision boundary level: phase inputs/outputs,
LLM calls, scores attached to traces. Not every internal function.

Add granularity only where gaps appear after a few weeks of data.
Over-instrumenting at the start adds maintenance cost before you know
what's useful.

**SDK v4 pattern used: `@observe()` decorator for cv-tailor, manual
observations for Job Radar.** cv-tailor has a clean phase-based
architecture that maps naturally to decorators. Job Radar uses the
Batch API (async, not real-time) which requires manual observation
creation after results arrive.

---

## 2. cv-tailor instrumentation

### 2.1 Project

One Langfuse project: `cv-tailor`. API keys from deployment setup.

### 2.2 Trace structure

Each cv-tailor run = one Langfuse trace. This is unchanged from the
original spec — only the code to produce it changes.

```
Trace: cv_tailor_run
  name = "cv_tailor_run"
  metadata = {
    run_id: "...",              ← stored in propagate_attributes, enables cross-system lookup
    mode: "demo" | "full",
    job_id: "sha256:..." | null,
    company: "Elastic" | null,
    job_radar_fit_label: "strong_fit" | null,
    job_radar_fit_score: 10 | null
  }

  Span: phase0_jd_analysis
    Generation: mistral_extraction
      model: "mistral-small" | "mistral-large"
      input: <JD text>
      output: <JDAnalysis JSON>
      usage: {input_tokens, output_tokens}

  Span: phase1_fit_assessment
    Generation: claude_fit_assessment
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-6" | "claude-haiku-4-5"
      input: <fit assessment prompt>
      output: <FitAssessment JSON>
      usage: {input_tokens, output_tokens}
    metadata = {
      outcome: "strong_fit" | "good_fit" | "partial" | "poor_fit",
      overall_fit_score: 0.72,
      cvcm_enabled: true
    }

  Span: phase2_cv_selection
    metadata = {
      candidates_evaluated: 3,
      selected_cv: "cv_director_2026.docx"
    }

  Span: phase3_refinement
    metadata = {iterations_run: 2, converged: true}

    Span: iteration_1
      Generation: claude_orchestrator
        model: "claude-sonnet-4-6"
        input: <orchestration prompt>
        output: <refinement decisions>
      Generation: haiku_section_rewrite  (0..N per iteration)
        model: "claude-haiku-4-5"
        input: <section + instructions>
        output: <rewritten section>
      metadata = {
        keyword_coverage: 0.35,
        critique_score: 7.2,
        sections_converged: 3,
        sections_active: 2
      }

    Span: iteration_2
      ... same structure ...

  Span: phase4_grounding
    Generation: claude_grounding_check
      model: "claude-haiku-4-5"
      input: <grounding prompt>
      output: <grounding result>
    metadata = {
      fabrication_flags: 0,
      grounded_coverage: 0.81
    }

  Span: phase5_cover_letter    (if generated)
    Generation: claude_cover_letter
      ...

  Span: phase6_final_assembly
    metadata = {
      output_format: "docx",
      sections_in_final: 8
    }

  Score: fit_score          = 0.56   (Phase 3 callback value)
  Score: coverage_score     = 0.35   (Phase 3 callback value)
  Score: cv_quality_score   = 8.1    (Phase 3 callback value)
  Score: job_radar_fit_score = 10    (from job_radar_source, if present)
```

### 2.3 SDK integration

Install:
```bash
pip install langfuse
```

Add to `requirements.txt`:
```
langfuse>=4.0.0
```

Create `tailor/telemetry.py` — initialises the client once and exposes
a helper to check if tracing is enabled. In SDK v4, `get_client()`
returns the global singleton; if no `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` is set the
client is still returned but tracing is silently disabled.

```python
# tailor/telemetry.py
import os
from langfuse import get_client, Langfuse

def init_langfuse() -> None:
    """Initialise Langfuse client if credentials are present.
    Call once at app startup (e.g. in main or runner init).
    No-op if LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY is absent — tracing disabled cleanly.
    """
    if os.getenv("LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"):
        Langfuse()  # initialises the global singleton

def is_enabled() -> bool:
    """Returns True if Langfuse credentials are configured."""
    return bool(os.getenv("LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY"))
```

**Tracing is opt-in by config.** No `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` in `.env` →
all `@observe()` decorators and context managers are no-ops. Tests run
without tracing. Production has it enabled. No mocking required.

### 2.4 Trace creation

In SDK v4, there is no explicit `lf.trace()` call. Instead, the root
`@observe()` decorated function *is* the trace. Trace-level metadata
is set via `propagate_attributes()`.

In `api/runner.py`:

```python
from langfuse import observe, propagate_attributes, get_client
from tailor.telemetry import is_enabled

@observe(name="cv_tailor_run")
def launch_run(run_id: str, job_radar_source: dict | None = None, mode: str = "demo", ...):
    # Set trace-level metadata — propagates to all child spans
    if is_enabled():
        with propagate_attributes(
            trace_name="cv_tailor_run",
            metadata={
                "run_id": run_id,
                "mode": mode,
                "job_id": job_radar_source.get("job_id") if job_radar_source else None,
                "company": job_radar_source.get("company") if job_radar_source else None,
                "job_radar_fit_label": job_radar_source.get("fit_label") if job_radar_source else None,
                "job_radar_fit_score": str(job_radar_source.get("fit_score")) if job_radar_source else None,
            }
        ):
            return run_pipeline(run_id, job_radar_source, mode, ...)
    else:
        return run_pipeline(run_id, job_radar_source, mode, ...)
```

> **v4 note on metadata values:** `propagate_attributes` requires
> `metadata` to be `dict[str, str]` — all values must be strings.
> Cast non-strings explicitly (e.g. `str(fit_score)`).

### 2.5 Phase spans

Each phase function gets an `@observe()` decorator. Because cv-tailor
phases are already separate functions, this is a one-line change per
phase. Child spans nest automatically via OTel context propagation.

```python
from langfuse import observe, get_client

@observe(name="phase0_jd_analysis", as_type="span")
def run_phase0(jd_text: str, ...):
    # instrument the Mistral call as a generation inside this span
    lf = get_client()
    with lf.start_as_current_observation(
        as_type="generation",
        name="mistral_extraction",
        model="mistral-small",
        input={"jd_text": jd_text},
    ) as gen:
        result = call_mistral(jd_text)
        gen.update(
            output=result,
            usage_details={"input_tokens": result.usage.input, "output_tokens": result.usage.output}
        )
    return result

@observe(name="phase1_fit_assessment", as_type="span")
def run_phase1(jd_analysis, cv_text, ...):
    lf = get_client()
    with lf.start_as_current_observation(
        as_type="generation",
        name="claude_fit_assessment",
        model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
        input={"jd_analysis": jd_analysis, "cv": cv_text},
    ) as gen:
        result = call_claude_fit(jd_analysis, cv_text)
        gen.update(
            output=result.assessment,
            usage_details={"input_tokens": result.usage.input, "output_tokens": result.usage.output}
        )
        # Update the parent span (phase1) with outcome metadata
        lf.update_current_observation(metadata={
            "outcome": result.assessment.fit_label,
            "overall_fit_score": str(result.assessment.overall_score),
        })
    return result

@observe(name="phase3_refinement", as_type="span")
def run_phase3(cv_draft, jd_analysis, ...):
    lf = get_client()
    for i, iteration in enumerate(run_iterations(...)):
        with lf.start_as_current_observation(
            as_type="span",
            name=f"iteration_{i+1}",
        ) as iter_span:
            # orchestrator call
            with lf.start_as_current_observation(
                as_type="generation",
                name="claude_orchestrator",
                model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
                input=iteration.orchestrator_prompt,
            ) as gen:
                decisions = call_orchestrator(iteration)
                gen.update(output=decisions)

            # section rewrites (0..N)
            for section in iteration.sections_to_rewrite:
                with lf.start_as_current_observation(
                    as_type="generation",
                    name="haiku_section_rewrite",
                    model="claude-haiku-4-5",
                    input={"section": section.name, "instructions": section.instructions},
                ) as gen:
                    rewritten = call_haiku_rewrite(section)
                    gen.update(output=rewritten)

            iter_span.update(metadata={
                "keyword_coverage": str(iteration.keyword_coverage),
                "critique_score": str(iteration.critique_score),
            })
```

### 2.6 Score attachment

In SDK v4, scores are attached via the API client, not the trace object.
Do this after the run completes in `api/runner.py`:

```python
from langfuse import get_client
from tailor.telemetry import is_enabled

def attach_scores(run_id: str, metrics: dict, job_radar_source: dict | None = None):
    if not is_enabled():
        return
    lf = get_client()
    scores = []
    if metrics.get("fit_score") is not None:
        scores.append({"name": "fit_score", "value": metrics["fit_score"]})
    if metrics.get("coverage_score") is not None:
        scores.append({"name": "coverage_score", "value": metrics["coverage_score"]})
    if metrics.get("cv_quality_score") is not None:
        scores.append({"name": "cv_quality_score", "value": metrics["cv_quality_score"]})
    if job_radar_source and job_radar_source.get("fit_score") is not None:
        scores.append({
            "name": "job_radar_fit_score",
            "value": job_radar_source["fit_score"] / 10  # normalise to 0–1
        })
    for score in scores:
        lf.api.scores.create(
            trace_id=run_id,
            name=score["name"],
            value=score["value"],
            data_type="NUMERIC",
        )
```

> **Why `lf.api.scores.create()`?** In v4, scores are attached via
> the REST API client rather than on a trace object, since there's no
> persistent trace object to call `.score()` on after the decorated
> function returns. The `run_id` ties the score back to the correct trace.

### 2.7 HITL decisions

Log HITL inputs as events on the current observation:

```python
from langfuse import get_client
from tailor.telemetry import is_enabled

def log_hitl_input(phase: str, hitl_text: str, interpretation: str):
    if not is_enabled():
        return
    lf = get_client()
    lf.create_event(
        name="hitl_input",
        metadata={
            "phase": phase,
            "input": hitl_text,
            "interpretation": interpretation,
        }
    )
```

### 2.8 What NOT to trace in cv-tailor

- Internal string manipulation, template rendering
- File I/O (reading/writing docx, json)
- The SSE event stream itself
- Individual token counts within a rewrite (aggregate at generation level)

---

## 3. Job Radar instrumentation

Build after cv-tailor instrumentation is confirmed working.

### 3.1 Project

One Langfuse project: `job-radar`. Separate from cv-tailor.

### 3.2 Trace structure

Unchanged from original spec — see section 3.2 in previous version.
Two targets: extraction batch and scoring run.

### 3.3 Batch API pattern

The Batch API is async — spans must be created after results arrive.
In v4, use `start_observation()` (manual, no context shift) for the
post-hoc pattern:

```python
from langfuse import get_client
from cli.telemetry import is_enabled

def record_extraction_batch(batch_id: str, batch_results: list, metadata: dict):
    if not is_enabled():
        return
    lf = get_client()

    # Root trace span for the whole batch
    with lf.start_as_current_observation(
        as_type="span",
        name="extraction_batch",
        input=metadata,
    ) as batch_span:
        with propagate_attributes(metadata={
            "batch_id": batch_id,
            "date": metadata["date"],
            "jd_count": str(len(batch_results)),
        }):
            for result in batch_results:
                with lf.start_as_current_observation(
                    as_type="span",
                    name="jd_extraction",
                    input={"job_id": result.job_id, "company": result.company},
                ) as jd_span:
                    with lf.start_as_current_observation(
                        as_type="generation",
                        name="claude_extraction",
                        model="claude-opus-4-8",
                        input=result.prompt,
                    ) as gen:
                        gen.update(
                            output=result.completion,
                            usage_details={
                                "input_tokens": result.usage.input,
                                "output_tokens": result.usage.output,
                            }
                        )
                    # Attach validation score
                    lf.api.scores.create(
                        trace_id=batch_id,
                        observation_id=jd_span.id,
                        name="validation_passed",
                        value=1 if result.validated else 0,
                        data_type="NUMERIC",
                    )
```

### 3.4 Cross-system linkage

Unchanged — cv-tailor trace is looked up by `run_id` which matches
the Langfuse trace name metadata. Both traces are independently
queryable and joinable via IDs stored in `corpus/cv_tailor_links.jsonl`.

---

## 4. Tests

### cv-tailor
- `@observe()` decorators are no-ops when `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` is absent
- No test env changes needed — tracing silently disabled
- Run existing test suite; must pass unchanged
- Add one smoke test: set `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` to a test project key,
  run one pipeline, confirm trace appears in Langfuse UI

### Job Radar
- Same pattern: no `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` → no tracing
- Existing 440 tests must pass unchanged

---

## 5. Build order

### Phase A — cv-tailor (build first)
1. `pip install langfuse`, add `langfuse>=4.0.0` to `requirements.txt`
2. Create `tailor/telemetry.py`
3. Call `init_langfuse()` at app startup
4. Add `@observe(name="cv_tailor_run")` to `launch_run()` in `runner.py`
5. Add `propagate_attributes()` block with trace metadata
6. Instrument Phase 0 — `@observe` + generation context manager
7. Instrument Phase 1 — `@observe` + generation + metadata update
8. Instrument Phase 3 — `@observe` + iteration spans + generation per rewrite
9. Instrument Phase 4 — `@observe` + generation + metadata
10. Attach scores via `lf.api.scores.create()` after run completes
11. Deploy, run one real cv-tailor job, verify trace in Langfuse UI
12. Instrument remaining phases (2, 5, 6) — lower priority

### Phase B — Job Radar (after cv-tailor confirmed)
1. `pip install langfuse`, add to `requirements.txt`
2. Create `cli/telemetry.py` (same pattern as cv-tailor)
3. Instrument extraction batch (post-batch context managers)
4. Instrument scoring run (spans, no generations)
5. Deploy, run one extraction, verify traces

---

## 6. Definition of Done — cv-tailor (Phase A)

1. A completed cv-tailor run produces a trace in Langfuse with:
   - `run_id` in trace metadata — enables cross-system lookup
   - Phase spans for Phase 0, 1, 3, 4
   - LLM generations with token counts
   - `fit_score`, `coverage_score`, `cv_quality_score` as trace scores
   - `job_radar_fit_score` attached when run came from Job Radar
2. Tracing disabled cleanly when `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` is absent
3. All existing cv-tailor tests pass unchanged

## 7. Definition of Done — Job Radar (Phase B)

1. Completed extraction batch produces trace with child spans per JD
2. Scoring run produces trace with dimension breakdown per JD
3. All existing Job Radar tests pass unchanged (440)
4. Traces queryable alongside cv-tailor traces in Langfuse UI

---

## 8. What this enables

Once both systems are instrumented and 20+ linked runs exist:

**In the Langfuse UI:**
- Filter cv-tailor traces by `metadata.job_id` — see every run for a
  specific Job Radar role
- Compare `job_radar_fit_score` vs `fit_score` on the same trace
- See which Phase 3 iterations took longest and cost most
- See HITL decisions and how Haiku interpreted them

**Via direct DB query (PostgreSQL + ClickHouse):**
- Join traces by `job_id` to answer the §7 research questions
- Compute average divergence between Job Radar and cv-tailor fit scores
  by company, domain, or role type
- Identify systematic extraction failures (low `validation_passed` rate
  for specific companies)

This is the raw material for the Phase 4 redesign — multi-agent scoring
orchestration grounded in evidence rather than assumption.
