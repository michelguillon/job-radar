# CLAUDE.md — job-radar

## Project

**job-radar** — personal job search intelligence system.
Identifies, assesses, prioritises, and tracks job opportunities.

Formerly: jd-refinery (renamed 2026-06-09 during respec).

---

## Sources of truth

| Source | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docs/job_radar_SPEC.md` | Architecture, implementation steps, phase scoping |
| `docs/CORPUS_FINDINGS.md` | Schema v1.2 definition, labelling rules, JD records |
| `models/record.py` | Executable schema — must stay in sync with CORPUS_FINDINGS §1.1 |

If CORPUS_FINDINGS §1.1 and `models/record.py` diverge, fix both and
bump `SCHEMA_VERSION`.

**Tie-break rule:** When spec prose and `models/record.py` disagree,
trust the executable artifact and fix the prose. The dataclass is the
thing tests actually run against.

---

## Build conventions

- **Docker only** — `docker compose run --rm job-radar python ...`
- **Tests always** — pytest, placed in `tests/`. Run after every step.
- **Schema locked at v1.2** — no changes without explicit instruction
- **Batch API only** for labelling — never synchronous extraction
- **BeautifulSoup only** for scraping — no Playwright, no Selenium
- **JSONL only** — no database, no ORM, no migrations
- **Append-only records** — never migrate in place; bump schema version
- **Extraction vs annotation boundary is strict** — Claude never
  populates annotation fields; human never populates extraction fields
- **CLI writes, UI reads** — all state changes through CLI scripts only
- **Stage CLIs live in `cli/` — create new ones there, never in the repo root.**
  A pipeline-stage / operational CLI (e.g. a future `digest.py`) goes in `cli/`
  as `cli/<stage>.py` with a `main()` + `if __name__ == "__main__"` guard, and is
  run as **`python -m cli.<stage>`** (e.g. `python -m cli.score`,
  `python -m cli.track list`) — NOT `python score.py` (a script run by path puts
  `cli/` on `sys.path` and can't import the repo-root packages; `-m` from the root
  can). One-off / throwaway corpus tools go in `scripts/`
  (`python -m scripts.<name>`). Root holds only `conftest.py`.
- **Git workflow — commit directly to `main`; no branches, no PRs.** Solo
  developer: make the change on `main`, show it for human review, then commit +
  push to `main` directly once approved. Do **not** create feature branches or
  open pull requests (this overrides the harness default of "branch first on the
  default branch"). Commit/push only when the user asks; commit messages still
  end with the `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- **Definition of done (EVERY task)** — a change is not complete until the
  docs are current. This is not optional and not an afterthought:
  1. **`docs/job_radar_SPEC.md`** — if anything about the architecture,
     pipeline, schema, or phase scope changed, update the SPEC in the **same**
     change. The SPEC must always describe the system as it actually is.
  2. **`docs/job_radar_LEARNINGS.md`** — append a learning entry for every
     decision, finding, reversal, or surprise (append-only; never rewrite
     existing entries). Capture the *why*, not just the *what*.
  3. The nearest **`CLAUDE.md`** — update conventions/state in the same change.
  Treat SPEC + LEARNINGS as part of the commit, alongside code and tests —
  never a "later" task.

## Phase state

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — Corpus Engine | ✅ complete — Steps 0–9, 95 tests. Pipeline end-to-end. |
| 2 — Scoring Engine | ✅ **complete (scorer v1)** — `scoring/{profile,scorer}.py` + `score.py`, 179 tests. Option A (`ApplicationRecord` v1.3 → `corpus/scored/`) + gates-vs-signal model + 3-tier role (primary/conditional/secondary) + capability/M&A blockers + negative-signal ceiling. Thresholds **set from evidence** (held against the 23-record corpus: 10 manual + 13 calibration). Calibration regression set: `corpus/calibration/`. Known limit F (extraction generosity) deferred. Conventions: `scoring/CLAUDE.md`. |
| 3 — Job Tracker | ✅ complete — `track.py` (model C, append-only event log), 263 tests. Extraction quality fixed (deviation 21). Real corpus build underway. Scorer locked. |
| 4 — Discovery Layer | ✅ complete — incremental collection (deviation 24) + `cli/digest.py` (deviation 26) + `cron/{collect_weekly,digest_daily}.sh` + `cron/README.md`. 313 tests. |
| 5 — Static UI | ✅ complete — `ui/{index.html,app.js,style.css}` static SPA (no framework/build/CDN), reads the joined `corpus/index.json`, served by nginx behind the `ui` Docker profile (`docker compose --profile ui up` → :8080). Browse + Pipeline + detail drawer + filters + stats bar. `index.json` contract changed to a join (deviation 27). 318 tests. |
| 6 — Interactive UI | ✅ complete — thin FastAPI `api/` (security/settings/main + index/auth/workflow/annotations routers) over `cli.track` + `models.record`; stdlib-HMAC `jr_write` cookie, fail-closed (`JR_WRITE_KEY`/`COOKIE_SECURE`); `GET /api/index` re-projects the live activity log; `ANNOTATION_TYPE` + `validate_annotation_event` (constants only, no schema bump); `corpus/annotations.jsonl` sink. **React/Vite `frontend/`** (cv-tailor stack: `UnlockProvider`, typed `lib/api`, `useIndex`, Browse/Pipeline/Detail + owner write controls + flag form) replaces the retired Phase 5 `ui/`. `api` + `frontend` compose services (`--profile ui` → :8080/:8000). **351 tests + browser-verified.** Conventions: `api/CLAUDE.md`, `frontend/CLAUDE.md` (deviations 28–31). |
| 7 — Fine-Tuned Analyser | Deferred (Project 5) |

## Step state (Phase 1)

| Step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Scaffold | ✅ complete | Docker, dirs, seeds, 10 manual records |
| 1 — JDRecord model | ✅ complete | v1.2, validate(), round-trip tests |
| 2 — Clean + dedupe | ✅ complete | clean(), record_hash(). SHA-256 backfill run in Step 3. |
| 3 — Greenhouse | ✅ complete | collectors/base.py + greenhouse.py + collect.py. Backfill done — 10 unique hashes, 0 pending. html.unescape() required on response body. |
| 4 — Lever + Ashby | ✅ complete | lever.py + ashby.py registered. Lever returns bare array + split description fields. Live: Mistral 170, Perplexity 71. |
| 5 — VC boards | ✅ complete | All boards JS-rendered (requires_js) — skeleton skips all; scraping deferred to Phase 4 |
| 6 — Tier 2 tooling | ✅ complete | tier2_review.py — a/e/s loop, resumable via corpus/tier2_progress.json. IO + extract injectable for tests. |
| 7 — Batch API labelling | ✅ complete | pipeline/label.py + label.py. Live verified: 5/5 labelled, $0.055, cost→stats.json. Prompt generated from executable schema enums. |
| 8 — Validation + stats | ✅ complete | validate.py → corpus/validated/{validated,failures}_*.jsonl; stats.py summary + --export-index → corpus/index.json (flat, UI contract). |
| 9 — Export | ✅ complete | export.py — prompt/completion JSONL; eval(1-3)/train(all-validated)/full(superset) sets. |

## Known deviations from spec (captured from build)

1. `SCHEMA_VERSION = "1.2"` (spec Step 1 text said 1.1 — typo, 1.2 is correct)
2. Records stored as compact single-line JSONL (not pretty-printed)
3. `.gitignore` uses `corpus/**/*` + negations to track skeleton, ignore data
4. Added: `models/__init__.py`, root `conftest.py`, `tests/factories.py`,
   `.gitattributes`, this `CLAUDE.md`, `collectors/base.py`, `scripts/`
5. `docker-compose.yml` marks `env_file` as `required: false`
6. SHA-256 backfill on 10 manual records run in Step 3 (deferred from Step 2)
7. `collectors/base.py` added — shared `fetch_json` retry/backoff +
   `build_raw_record`; each collector is URL + field mapping only
8. `scripts/` package for one-off corpus maintenance
9. `docker-compose.yml` service renamed `jd-refinery` → `job-radar`
10. Greenhouse `?content=true` returns HTML entity-escaped content —
    `html.unescape()` run on response body before storing `raw_html`
11. Lever returns bare JSON array + split description fields (not `{"jobs":[...]}`)
12. `pipeline/merge_results` seeds neutral annotation defaults after labelling
    so whole-record validation passes before human annotates
13. Prompt closed-vocabulary section generated from `models.record` enums —
    not hand-listed; prompt caching active on system prefix
14. (Phase 2) Schema versioned **per record type**: `SCHEMA_VERSION="1.3"`
    (ApplicationRecord) + `JDRECORD_SCHEMA_VERSION="1.2"` (frozen). The three
    sites that hard-coded `SCHEMA_VERSION` for a JDRecord envelope (`factories`,
    `test_record`, `stats.export_index`) were repointed at `JDRECORD_SCHEMA_VERSION`.
15. (Phase 2 scorer) The `role` dimension is **no longer a flat `target_roles`
    lookup** (deviates from SPEC §6.5). It is three-tier — primary (2.0) /
    `conditional_primary` (Product: 2.0 if a relevant domain or strong+weak signal,
    else 1.0) / secondary (1.0) / no match (0). Profile gained
    `conditional_primary` + `secondary` under `target_roles`.
16. (Phase 2 scorer, **known limitation — F, deferred**) Tier-4 automated
    extraction is generous on `role_type` mapping and defaults to `Enterprise
    Software` as a catch-all `domain`. Because `Enterprise Software` is a *strong*
    domain, this inflates some off-target roles; scorer gates/blockers partially
    recover. Full fix = extraction-prompt/corpus maintenance, deferred to a later
    phase.
17. **Calibration corpus** lives in `corpus/calibration/` (13 deliberately
    negative / conditional JDs) and is **excluded from train/eval/fine-tune
    exports** (`export.py` skips any `calibration` path). It is a **permanent
    scorer regression set** — re-run `python -m scripts.report_calibration --full`
    whenever the scorer changes, and re-validate the spread before locking a change.
18. (Phase 3) **Collectors now return `CollectedJob` (record + metadata)**, not a
    bare `JDRecord`. The ATS APIs expose `title` + structured location that the
    schema-locked `JDRecord` has no field for; rather than overload `raw_text`
    (which stays **employer JD text only**), `collect.py` writes a parallel
    **metadata sidecar** `corpus/raw/meta_{date}.jsonl` (`base.META_FIELDS`,
    keyed by `source_url`). Used by the pre-label filter now and passed to the
    extraction prompt as separate context later — never injected into `raw_text`.
19. (Phase 3) **Pre-label filter** = `pipeline/prefilter.py` (pure location + role
    screens, generous by design) + `prefilter.py` CLI (clean+dedupe → screen →
    **near-dedupe** → `corpus/filtered/filtered_{date}.jsonl` + survivor-distribution
    report). Runs **before** any Batch labelling spend. Screens read the sidecar
    only (no model, no scoring). `collapse_near_duplicates` merges survivors that
    share `(company, language-stripped title)` — the same role posted to many
    locations / language variants that exact-body dedupe can't catch — keeping the
    single best-located representative (UK first); specialisation parentheticals
    are preserved so distinct roles aren't merged. The survivors file is JDRecords
    only; the sidecar remains the join source for the later labelling step.
20. (Phase 3) **Labelling collected survivors.** Survivors have `raw_text=""`
    (only `raw_html`). `pipeline.clean.clean_readable` populates `raw_text` for
    labelling/scoring — HTML/boilerplate stripped but **line breaks + case kept**
    (the hash-form `clean()` lowercases to one line, which breaks the scorer's
    first-line title heuristic). Sidecar `title`/`location` go to the prompt as a
    separate **`[ATS METADATA]`** block (`label.build_user_content`, `label.py
    --meta`), never merged into `raw_text`. `scripts/build_score_subset.py` builds
    a representative run subset; `scripts/score_report.py` reports a scoring run.
21. (Phase 3) **Known Limitation F — observed in production, then fixed in the
    extraction prompt** (scorer untouched). `build_system_prompt` gained role/domain
    disambiguation: Product Marketing → `GTM` (not `Product`); post-sales/Customer
    Success is not `AI Delivery`; **no "Enterprise Software" default** (`domain: []`
    when nothing applies — `domain` is a list, no `not_stated`). Re-label + diff
    through the unchanged scorer: Enterprise Software in `domain` 27→10 (prod) / 6→1
    (calibration), Product-Marketing roles left `strong_fit`, OneOcean de-inflated,
    **no calibration negative flipped positive**. Calibration baseline kept locked
    (re-labels → new comparison files). Scorer stays locked until the 100+-job review.
22. (Phase 3) **GTM/partner observation watchlist** (SPEC §5.10) — `prefilter.py`
    diverts location-workable GTM/partner-class roles (`watchlist_signal` + role
    bucket `gtm_partner`/`off_target`) out of the labelling/scoring stream into an
    append-only log `corpus/watchlist/watchlist_{date}.jsonl`. **Observation only:
    never labelled, scored, or made into an ApplicationRecord; zero Batch cost.**
    Gathers evidence on whether `GTM` should become a `target_role` *before* any
    profile/scorer change — `GTM` deliberately stays out of `target_roles` for now.
23. (Phase 3) **Job Tracker `track.py` — model C + Log-only** (supersedes SPEC
    §7.4's earlier "updates ApplicationRecord in corpus/scored/" sketch, which was
    in tension with the pure scorer). Workflow state lives **only** in the
    append-only event log `corpus/activity_log.jsonl` (`{v, ts, job_id, event,
    value, notes}`; `event ∈ {status, outcome, note, title}`). `track.py` **only
    appends** — it never mutates a scored file and never touches the scorer, so a
    re-score (which regenerates every `ApplicationRecord` with
    `application_status="new"`) can't wipe human state. **Live state = latest
    score joined with a projection folded from the log by `job_id`** (latest
    status/outcome, earliest-`applied` date, latest non-empty note). `outcome` and
    `application_date` are **derived at read time — never persisted on
    `ApplicationRecord`** (no schema bump; `SCHEMA_VERSION` stays 1.3). Vocab only
    added to `models/record.py`: `OUTCOME`, `ACTIVITY_EVENT`, `ACTIVITY_LOG_VERSION`,
    `validate_activity_event`. Transitions are **forgiving** (warn, never block);
    unknown `job_id` is refused unless `--force`. `list` sorts by `priority_score`
    desc and shows all labels; `--location-workable` is a **coarse, sidecar-derived
    read-only** signal (no scoring change). **Title resolution**: human override
    (`--title` → a `title` event) → sidecar title → `raw_text` first line →
    `job_id` (the schema-locked JDRecord has no title field and the sidecar
    collides on legacy `source_url="unknown"`; the override is the per-`job_id`
    escape hatch — presentation only, never scored). `corpus/activity_log.jsonl` is **git-
    ignored** like other corpus data (mutable personal state). Stable join key
    caveat: a JD text change → new content hash → new `job_id` → workflow does not
    carry to the new revision (accepted, not a bug).
24. (Phase 4) **Incremental collection is client-side, not server-side.** The
    public ATS **board** APIs expose **no `updated_after`/date-filter param**
    (Greenhouse's `updated_after` is **Harvest API only**; Lever/Ashby boards take
    none — verified against the authoritative docs). So `collect.py` fetches the
    (single, cheap) full list per company and filters **client-side** on each job's
    own timestamp via `collectors.base.passes_cursor`. The cost saved is the
    **downstream Batch-labelling** spend (≈O(new) records enter the paid pipeline),
    not the bulk GET. Per-source **cursor** `corpus/.last_collected_{source}`
    (gitignored) = **start** timestamp of the last successful run (start-not-finish,
    so a mid-run update is re-caught). Capability differs per source: greenhouse
    `updated_at` (new+edited), ashby `publishedAt` (**new only** — no `updatedAt` on
    the feed; `--full` reconciles edits), **lever none → always full**.
    `INCREMENTAL_SOURCES` derives from each collector's `SUPPORTS_INCREMENTAL`.
    `--full` re-fetches everything (schema change/debug) then re-baselines.
    Cursors advance **only** on a full-source run (no `--company`) that returned ≥1
    job; a missing/unparseable per-job timestamp is **kept** (never silently drop a
    posting). Matrix + rationale: `collectors/CLAUDE.md`; mechanics: `SPEC §8.2`.
25. (Housekeeping) **Stage CLIs moved from repo root into the `cli/` package**
    (`git mv`, history preserved): `collect, dedupe, export, label, prefilter,
    score, stats, tier2_review, track, validate`. Invocation changed from
    `python <stage>.py` to **`python -m cli.<stage>`** — a script run by path
    (`python cli/score.py`) puts `cli/` on `sys.path` and can't import the
    repo-root packages, whereas `-m` from the repo root keeps the root importable
    and CWD-relative corpus paths intact (same pattern as the existing
    `scripts/` package). No code logic changed; test imports became
    `import cli.<stage>`; `conftest.py` stays at root. Root now holds only
    `conftest.py`.
26. (Phase 4) **Daily digest `cli/digest.py` is a view over tracker state, not a
    pipeline stage.** It reuses `cli.track`'s loaders + `project` + `_title_for` +
    `sort_rows` to join the latest score per `job_id` with the JD/sidecar and the
    activity-log projection, then shows roles whose `scored_at` ≥ a window start
    (columns: company | role | fit_label | fit_score | location | source_url, sorted
    by `priority_score` desc). **Since-cursor** `corpus/.digest_last_run` (gitignored)
    holds the **start** timestamp of the last *default* run (start-not-finish, same
    reasoning as the collect cursor); no cursor → last 24h. `--since` (ISO
    date/datetime / `yesterday` / `today`) overrides the window and is a one-off
    lookback that does **not** advance the cursor (mirrors collect's "`--company`
    subset doesn't advance"). `--min-fit` default 6; roles already tracked (workflow
    status ≠ `new`) are excluded unless `--all`; `--export` writes
    `corpus/digest_{date}.md`. Caveat: a full manual re-score restamps every
    `scored_at` and would resurface the whole corpus — incremental collection keeps
    the normal (cron) digest bounded to genuinely-new postings. `cron/` holds the
    two bash wrappers (`collect_weekly.sh`, `digest_daily.sh`) + `README.md`; both
    run each stage in Docker and timestamp-log to `/var/log/job-radar/`.
27. (Phase 5) **`corpus/index.json` is a join, not a JDRecord array** (revises the
    SPEC §9.4 "flat denormalised array of validated records" sketch). The UI needs
    scoring + **live workflow status**, which a JDRecord doesn't carry, so
    `cli.stats --export-index` now emits the **same join the tracker does**
    (deviation 23): it imports `cli.track`'s loaders + `project` + `_title_for` +
    `derive_location_workable`, joins latest `ApplicationRecord` per `job_id` ⨝
    `JDRecord` extraction ⨝ sidecar ⨝ activity-log projection, one denormalised row
    per **scored** job. Output is an **object** `{schema_version,
    jdrecord_schema_version, generated_at, stats, records}` (not a bare array — the
    old `test_export_index_is_flat_array` was replaced). `stats` (counts +
    `fit_score_distribution` + `cost_to_date_usd`, summed from `corpus/stats.json`)
    is **embedded** so the single mounted file is self-contained — the UI container
    mounts only `index.json`, never `stats.json` or the corpus. The UI
    (`ui/{index.html,app.js,style.css}`, vanilla JS, no framework/build/CDN) fetches
    it at `data/index.json` and is **strictly read-only** (no POST/write/CLI). Docker
    `ui` service is profile-gated (`profiles: ["ui"]`) so it never starts with the
    default `docker compose up`; the `ui/` mount is **not** `:ro` (Docker must create
    the nested `data/` mountpoint inside it — only the `index.json` file mount is
    `:ro`). `index.json` stays gitignored corpus data. Title fallbacks inherit the
    tracker's `_title_for` chain, so JDs whose sidecar title is missing show the
    `raw_text` first line (cosmetic, same known limit as the tracker).
28. (Phase 6, M1) **Capability cookie is stdlib HMAC, not `itsdangerous`** (supersedes
    SPEC §10.8 step 8). `api/security.py` is copied/adapted from cv-tailor's proven,
    zero-dep `hmac`+`hashlib` module — cookie `jr_write` (HttpOnly, SameSite=lax, Secure
    via `COOKIE_SECURE`, path `/api`), owner key env `JR_WRITE_KEY`, `require_unlocked`
    FastAPI dependency on every write router. **Fail-closed**: no `JR_WRITE_KEY` → all
    writes 403 (clean public read-only). The backend is the source of truth; UI hiding is
    convenience only. `itsdangerous` is **not** a dependency.
29. (Phase 6, M1) **`GET /api/index` re-projects the live activity log over `index.json`**
    (clarifies SPEC §13.4). Workflow writes land in `activity_log.jsonl` *after* the last
    `cli.stats --export-index`, so a naive file-serve looks stale right after a write.
    `api/routers/index.py` serves the heavy pre-built join **and** overlays
    `project(load_events(LOG_PATH))` (cheap) — status/outcome/application_date/notes/title
    are always live without a re-score. Annotations don't affect the read model.
30. (Phase 6, M1) **The `api` compose service reuses the `job-radar` image** (it already
    `pip install`s `requirements.txt`, now incl. fastapi/uvicorn/httpx) rather than a
    separate `Dockerfile.api` as SPEC §10.4 sketched — the service just runs `uvicorn
    api.main:app …`. Profile-gated (`profiles:["ui"]`, port 8000). Only the M2 frontend
    gets its own Dockerfiles. The **thin-layer rule** (import `cli.track` + `models.record`,
    never the scorer/labeller/pipeline; gate every write; fail-closed) lives in `api/CLAUDE.md`.
31. (Phase 6, M2) **The `frontend` compose service runs the Vite dev server**
    (`frontend/Dockerfile.dev`, `npm run dev` on :3000, mapped `8080:3000`), which proxies
    `/api` → `api:8000` (same-origin, so the `jr_write` cookie rides along). The multi-stage
    `Dockerfile.prod` (node build → nginx serve) + `frontend/nginx.conf` exist for the
    **deferred §10.9 deployment**, not the local profile. **Image-tag-collision gotcha:** a
    manual `docker build -t job-radar-frontend` collides with the compose-assigned image name
    `<project>-frontend` → `docker compose up` silently **reuses the stale image** instead of
    building `Dockerfile.dev`. Always `docker compose --profile ui up -d --build frontend`.
    The Phase 5 static `ui/{index.html,app.js,style.css,.gitignore,CLAUDE.md}` was deleted
    (git history preserves it); conventions live in `frontend/CLAUDE.md`. The React write
    controls reuse the M1 endpoints — no new write logic client-side; `credentials:"include"`
    on every fetch carries the capability cookie.

## Schema summary

Two record types live in `models/record.py`, versioned **per type** (Option A):

```
JDRecord          extraction   Claude populates   objective    v1.2 (frozen)
ApplicationRecord assessment   scorer populates   subjective   v1.3 (built)
JobPosting        product      system populates   operational  (deferred)
```

- `SCHEMA_VERSION = "1.3"` (project / `ApplicationRecord`);
  `JDRECORD_SCHEMA_VERSION = "1.2"` (JDRecord envelope, **not migrated**).
- `JDRecord`'s Phase-1 annotation fields are now **legacy stubs** — the scorer
  never reads or writes them. New scoring output lives only in `ApplicationRecord`
  (`corpus/scored/`). `JobPosting` and the full annotation migration are a later,
  explicit step.

---

## Export set definitions

```
eval    Tier 1+2+3 human-reviewed only — held-out eval set, never training
train   All tiers validated — fine-tuning input
full    Everything including failures — inspection only, never training
```

`train` ≈ `full` currently (few Tier 4 records, low failure rate).
The separation exists by design for when scale makes it matter.

## CLAUDE.md hierarchy

Keep this file lean. Add area-specific conventions to nested files:

- `collectors/CLAUDE.md` — API client patterns, encoding gotchas, **incremental
  capability matrix** (exists)
- `pipeline/CLAUDE.md` — batch API patterns, cost tracking, label-merge defaults
- `scoring/CLAUDE.md` — scoring logic, profile schema (Phase 2+)
- `ui/CLAUDE.md` — Phase 5 static-UI conventions, index.json join contract (exists)
- `api/CLAUDE.md` — Phase 6 thin-backend invariants: import `cli.track`/`models.record`,
  never the scorer; gate every write with `require_unlocked`; fail-closed; live overlay
  on `GET /api/index`; env (`JR_WRITE_KEY`/`COOKIE_SECURE`) (exists)
- `frontend/CLAUDE.md` — Phase 6 M2 React conventions (added with M2)
